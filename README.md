# JaSON API

Too many Jasons?

## Is the `firstName` field just a hardcoded `"Jason"` string?

Yes, yes it is.

## Notes

Some mutation are commented out in the schema (as are their respective resolvers).
They are fully functional, but disabled because the GraphQL playground is open and I don't want the internet to have free reign over the database 🤷‍♂
