# JaSON API

Too many Jasons?

## Is the `firstName` field just a hardcoded `"Jason"` string?

Yes, yes it is.

## dev notes

- add prettier and eslint
- ?Gatsby frontend
- ?frontend talk to backend with graphql hooks
- likes, will help me learn more things. Doesn't matter it doesn't make sense for a Jason to have upvotes, do it FOR SCIENCE
